# Week 1 report
## Tasks done
I chose the topic for my project. This week's main task has been familiarizing myself to Markov chains using articles and videos found on the internet. \
I created this GitHub repository and connected both local repositories on my student laptop (fuksiläppäri) and home PC to it.

## What I learned
I learned that Markov chains have much to do with linear algebra and thankfully I have completed two courses regarding that topic this past spring. \
I also introduced myself to trie -data structures as I will be using one in this project.

## Going forward
I'm mostly on board with what to do next. However, the course material has much information about preparing testing environment and creating excecutable program for Java. I'm not sure if I can follow those steps as my programming language will be Python. \
Those will be the areas I will have to prepare next week and begin to write actual code. \
Used hours: 8.
