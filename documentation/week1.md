# Week 1 report
## Tasks done
I chose the topic for my project. This week's main task has been familiarizing myself to Markov chains using articles and videos found on the internet. \
I created this GitHub repository and connected both local repositories on my student laptop (fuksiläppäri) and home PC to it. \
The developing environment has been prepared with Poetry. Unittest folder is also ready to be edited.

## What I learned
I learned that Markov chains have much to do with linear algebra and thankfully I have completed two courses regarding that topic this past spring. \
I also introduced myself to trie -data structures as I will be using one in this project.

## Going forward
I'm mostly on board with what to do next. Next week I will have to beging developing the actual program and continue to deepen my knowledge of Markov chains \
The scale of this project is still a mystery for me, but I believe it won't be anything I can't handle. \
Used hours: 8.
