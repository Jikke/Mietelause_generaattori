# Week 2 report
## Tasks done
Week 2 has been all about programming first barebones version of the project. \
I created Files-class to read source file for quotes and Slicer-class to slice textfile contents into usable form. \
At the moment the main data structure is nested dictionary. I will probably change it later on into dictionary with words as keys and 2-item tuples as values with word following the dictionary keyword as first item and number of times it has followed the keyword as second item. \
For why I'm using the nested dictionary for now at least is that I want to be able to find, get and modify values in and from there rapidly. It comes with a price in the memory usage, but it isn't my main concern just yet. \
I have used the triple-quotation style for commenting my class methods. I'm not sure if it is the right way to do it on this course. 

## What I learned
I have not used regex methods before. The way I use them to split and slice textlines is not the most clean and efficient but it gets the job done. \
Nested dictionaries gave me a good headache but it was worth it to recall those things aswell. 

## Going forward
For the next week, I must start programming unittests and publish test coverage report. \
Other task will be acutally using the data collected into the nested dictionary using Markov chain. Maybe I will be able to generate my first quotes! 

Used hours: 6.
