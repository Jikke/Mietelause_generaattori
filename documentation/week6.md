# Week 6 report
## Tasks done
Updated the create_quote -method to take also beginning words of the desired quote as arguments. This method uses get_leaf() -method to generate the quote as it should using trie-datastructure. \
Refactored and cleaned code. \
Wrote space complexity report, test report and instruction documentation. \
Updated README with general information of the project and executing instructions. \
Added simple performance check to ui.py.

## What I learned
Previously the create_quote() didn't actually take into account previous words as it should. \
Even if the words were saved according to the given Markov chain level, they were always picked according to first level Markov chain. \
I had to recall the topics of space complexity and Big-O notation. 

## Going forward
Next week I will write the rest of needed documentation and make the GitHub release of the finalized project. 

Used hours: 12.
