# Week 5 report
## Tasks done
Created simple text based user interface \
Made the trie-datastructure modifiable by the user. Now given Markov chain level determines the storing of the sentences. \
Unittest coverage risen to 97%. \
Written implementation document and time complexities into it.

## What I learned
This week I finally understood how trie was meant to be applied in this project. \
I had to recall the topics of time complexity and Big-O notation.

## Going forward
This week was once again stressful but also rewarding. Next week I will have to write the space complexity report. \
I'm not sure how I will implement other kind of testing now that unittesting is well done. \
I will try to come up how to graphically express the way this trie-datastructure is storing data.


Used hours: 10.
