# Week 3 report
## Tasks done
This week I replaced the Dictionary-class with Trie- and Trienode-classes. From now on, trie will be the datastructure of this project. \
I was also able to generate my first quotes with Handler-class'(the console of the program) create_quote -method! \
Unittest have been created and the coverage is 73%. \
All of the methods have docstrings attached to them to improve the clarity of code. \
Tasks.py was created into root folder to make recurring commands easier to use.

## What I learned
The main point I had to learn this week was the usage of trie datastructure. The idea of it is pretty simple, but using it in practise was tricky at times. \
I had to recall unittesting.

## Going forward
I must write unittests for the last methods of Handler-class. \
The quote_archive need a lot more quotes as the generator makes pretty similar ones to them at the moment.


Used hours: 11.
